  The entrypoint for defining your web interface, such
  as controllers, views, channels and so on.

  This can be used in your application as:

      use EfossilsWeb, :controller
      use EfossilsWeb, :view

  The definitions below will be executed for every view,
  controller, etc, so keep them short and clean, focused
  on imports, uses and aliases.

  Do NOT define functions inside the quoted expressions
  below. Instead, define any helper function in modules
  and import those modules here.
